--
-- This module provides access to the BSD /socket/ interface.  This
-- module is generally more efficient than the 'String' based network
-- functions in 'Network.Socket'.  For detailed documentation, consult
-- your favorite POSIX socket reference. All functions communicate
-- failures by converting the error number to 'System.IO.IOError'.
--
-- This module is made to be imported with 'Network.Socket' like so:

-- > import Network.Socket.ByteString

-- receive should be a small power of 2, e.g., 4096.
